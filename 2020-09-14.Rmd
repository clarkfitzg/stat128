- describe high level idea of data frames
- load external CSV file
- select columns by name
- `class, dim, head, tail, unique, table`

123GO - On a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (hard), how difficult did you find the last homework?

Write LaTex $x + y$.

Announcements:

- Ask more questions! Discord
- Note in the assignment if you work with someone else.
- But still do the work yourself.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
hist(rnorm(100))
```

`data[rows, columns]`
`data[, columns]`

Ways to select a column "A"

1. data[, "A"]
1. data[["A"]]
1. data$A
1. with(data, A)

`with(data, plot(x, y))`


## data frames

```{r}
?data.frame
```

sounds important!

matrix like structure, with columns of the same type

A data frame is like a spreadsheet! or a table

Use autocompletion for faster, more accurate typing.

An example:
```{r}
airquality
```
```{r}
class(airquality)
```

Use `class` to see how the object behaves.
R uses the value of `class` to dispatch in object oriented programming.

```{r}
dim(airquality)
```

dim for dimensions.
153 rows, and 6 columns.

Each row is a record / observation

ncols << nrows 

What's the biggest table you've ever seen?
millions


```{r}
head(airquality)
```

```{r}
summary(airquality)
```


## select columns

```{r}
colnames(airquality)
```

Select the "Temp" column

```{r}
temperature = airquality[, "Temp"]
```

123go - what's the class of temperature?

```{r}
class(temperature)
```

Line plot:
```{r}
plot(temperature, type = "l")
```



Multiple columns

Temp and Ozone
```{r}
c("Temp", "Ozone")
temp_ozone = airquality[, c("Temp", "Ozone")]
class(temp_ozone) # 123 go -what is this?
```

`with` allows you to type an expression using column names of a data frame as variables.
```{r}
with(temp_ozone, plot(Temp, Ozone))
```



## load files

local on my machine or somewhere else?

```{r}
air = read.csv("http://webpages.csus.edu/fitzgerald/files/stat128/fall20/ad_viz_plotval_data.csv")
```

R visited my website, downloaded the data, and parsed it into a data.frame.


## your turn


```{r}
class
dim
head
summary
```

Which sites are represented in this data set?
Hint:
To find the unique values of the column "Month" in the `airquality` data we can do:

```{r}
unique(airquality[, "Month"])
```

Or, more informatively:

```{r}
table(airquality[, "Month"])
```

So there are 31 days in month 5 (May),
