If you want to be a good software developer, then learn to debug.

123 GO:
What's a bug in software?


Four kinds of bugs:

1) Syntax Errors- The code isn't syntactically valid R.
2) Runtime Errors- the code throws an error in the middle of evaluation.
3) Code runs, but gives you something obviously incorrect.
4) Code runs, and everything seems fine, but it's wrong.

123 GO - which are the easiest to fix?
Syntax errors

Tools for dealing with bugs:

1) Syntax errors: IDE that points to where the problem is.
2) Enter the debugger when you encounter an error. `options(error = recover)`
3) Step through the function where something goes wrong. `browser()` or set breakpoints in IDE.
4) Unit tests, small tests to verify correct behavior.
  Don't have time to get into these.
