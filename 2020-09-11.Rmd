## Named vectors

A vector is an ordered sequence of data.

Make some random data, `x`.
`runif` r is for random
unif is for uniform
```{r}
n = 26
x = runif(n)
names(x) = letters
```

Seeding the random number generator makes it start generating random numbers from the same place.

```{r}
n = 26
set.seed(128)
x = runif(n)  # Uses the RNG
names(x) = letters
x
```

"psuedo random number generators"

```{r}
n = 26  # <--- 26 is a Hardcoded value, which is generally bad practice.
set.seed(128)
x = runif(n)  # Uses the RNG
names(x) = letters
x

# OR 123 go which is better?

set.seed(128)
x = runif(length(letters))   # Doesn't rely on specifying n
names(x) = letters
x

# same idea as above

n = length(letters)
set.seed(128)
x = runif(n)   # Doesn't rely on specifying n
names(x) = letters
x
```
hardcoding is bad because:

- Length of letters could change!
- manual data entry is error prone.
- tedious
- mistakes can propagate through
- DRY "don't repeat yourself"

So why ever hardcode?

- It's convenient / easy


## Helpful functions for homework

`names, sort, head, tail, hist, %in%, x["a"]`
Raminro, Richard, Rocky, Roman, Sarah, Sergio

`decreasing = FALSE` is the default argument.
We change it with `sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)`.

TODO: Fix so students can download live notes.

```{r}
sort(x)

sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)
```
`names, sort, head, tail, hist, %in%, x["a"]`
Raminro, Richard, Rocky, Roman, Sarah, Sergio

```{r}
hist(x)
```


```{r}
x[c("b", "a")]
```


sorting by name:
```{r}
x[sort(names(x))]
```

```{r}
"a" %in% names(x) # is "a" in the names of x?
```


## Summary statistics



Measures of center:
```{r}
mean(x)
median(x)
mean(x, trim = 0.05)
```

Outliers
```{r}
y = c(x, 10)
mean(y)

```

123GO
Will this be the same as `mean(x)`?
```{r}
mean(y, trim = 0.05)
```

```{r}
x[1] == y[1]
```




Measures of spread:
```{r}
sd(x)
quantile(x)
range(x)
summary(x)
```



## Exponent notation

Scientific notation
```
