123 go: What food are you craving?

## Announcements

1. First homework will be available this weekend.
  Worth 45% of course grade, in contrast to the 5% for review (see syllabus)
2. CA Election Data Challenge
<https://csus.instructure.com/courses/67306/discussion_topics/550411>

## Objectives

- Define the following terms, and identify them in an R expression:
    - assignment `x = 4` or `x <- 4`
    - variable name `x`
    - function call `foo(x, y, z)` name of the function is `foo`. 
    - argument `x, y, z`, You'll see `foo`, `bar` used as generic variable names.
- Look up built in documentation `?abs`
- Search for error messages, and take out the part specific to our problem.


### Assignment 
```{r}
x = 4
x <- 4   # Exactly the same thing
```
The name: `x`
The value: 4

```{r}
?`=`
```
Assign a value to a name.

```{r}
x + 3
```
```{r}
x
```

What is that `[1]` in front of the 7?

YES! The position in the vector.
```{r}
1:100
```
```{r}
x = 3
x + 1
```

Old `x` is gone, replaced with the new `x`.
```{r}
x = 4
```

Suppose we want to assign `x + 4` to the variable `y`. How?

```{r}
y = x + 4
```

In general, the expression on the right can be very complicated

```{r}
y = log(x) + x^2 + sin(x - 2/17)
```




### Function calls

Functions are the heart of R.

```{r}
sqrt(4)
sqrt(x)
```

`sqrt` is the function.
`4` is the __argument__.
A function can take 0, 1, or many arguments.
`f(...)`




### Documentation

```{r}
?sqrt
```

```{r}
sqrt(y)
```

`sqrt(-1) = i`

```{r}
sqrt(-1)
```

123go - imaginary number, or something else?
think about design principles of R-
do the right thing interactively.

If you want complex numbers:
```{r}
1 + 5i
```




### Errors

Q: Predict what will happen
```{r}
sqrt(four)
```
`four` is a variable name, not a literal number like `4`

Suppose you have no idea what this error means.
What do you do?
Google it!
Make a search that google can actually find.
Remove the parts that are specific to our example.

Original: "Error: object 'four' not found"
Google this: "Error: object not found"

R is case-sensitive, which means: `sqrt != Sqrt`.
```{r}
Sqrt(4)
```



### packages

External R software, community contributed, open source.


### Office hours

"There is no package data.table"

Google this: "There is no package "

Solution is to install the package first.
```{r}
install.packages("data.table")
```

How to type code in the text editor and send it right to the console.
```{r}
2 + 3
```

R is based on vectors... so everything is a vector, there are no scalars.

```{r}
x = 1:10
```

add 1 to each element of `x`
```{r}
x + 1
```
