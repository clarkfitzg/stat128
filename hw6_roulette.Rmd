#### Outcomes

- Define custom functions
- Split, apply, and combine data
- Analyze long term simulation results


#### Instructions

- Answer the following questions, and show all your R code.
- Upload your submission to Canvas in nicely formatted HTML generated from Rstudio.

You can use the functions we've developed in class for this assignment.

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarkfitzg/stat128/master/roulette.R")
```

You may also find it helpful to borrow [code from lecture](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/stat128/blob/master/2020-10-12.Rmd).


# Questions

## 1 - A fancy function

_The goal of statistical simulations is to understand the properties and general patterns in random objects.
One way to uncover these patterns is to do many simulations, until the trend lines in the plots become obvious._

_Write a function to produce a detailed plot similar to the [plot displayed in class](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/stat128/blob/master/long_term_roulette.png) on Monday, October 12th.
Include the following features:_

- visually important line for median winnings at each time point
- dashed line for 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles of the winning at each time point
- several semitransparent lines (set `alpha < 1`) representing actual simulated sequences of winnings for players
- informative labels, title, and caption

_The function should return a ggplot object, and accept at least the following arguments:_

- `strategy`, defaulting to `simple_strategy(even)`, or one of the other 1:1 betting strategies
- `quants`, defaulting to 0.9, to denote the proportion of the data between the dashed lines
- `nplayers`, with a default large enough to get reasonably smooth looking dashed quantile lines with the default strategy
- `nplayers_plot`, defaulting to 10, number of semitransparent lines to plot
- `ntimes`, with a default sufficiently large to see where the 0.95 quantile intersects 0 with the default strategy
- `print`, defaulting to `TRUE`, whether to print the final plot

_Hint: I suggest you write at least two other functions, one to compute the summary statistics at each time point, and one to do all the plotting based on the simulated data._

```{r}
# TODO
```

_Call your function with all the defaults, to make sure it works._

```{r}
# TODO
```

## 2 - Analysis

Use the function you wrote above to answer the following questions.

_1. What happens when we increase the number of players?_

```{r}
# TODO show difference when increase players
```

TODO explain

_2. Approximately how many times do you need to play before 95% of players have lost money? Explain this result to a person who thinks they can make money gambling._

TODO explain

_3. What happens when you use a betting strategy that does not have a 1 to 1 payout?_

```{r}
# TODO
```

TODO explain


## 3 - Martingale Fails

_Pick your favorite casino and find out the minimum and maximum bet for a Euro roulette table from [Online United States Casino](https://www.onlineunitedstatescasinos.com/las-vegas/games/roulette/).
Suppose you have 5,000 dollars to spend on gambling, and once you lose that, you cannot play more.
Given these numbers, use a large number of simulations to answer ONE of the following questions relating to the martingale (doubling) betting strategy with a 1 to 1 payout._

1. On average, how long can you play before going bankrupt?
2. Does the martingale strategy let you play longer than the simple strategies above?
3. Suppose a dealer spins the roulette wheel once a minute.
  If you go to Las Vegas to play for a weekend, what's the probability you will lose all your money?
