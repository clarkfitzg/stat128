title: Analyzing Simulations
date: 4 October 2020
---

#### Outcomes

- Visualize and compare complex data
- Use higher order functions
- Explain unfamiliar code written by another person


#### Background

As promised, in this assignment we will use the functions representing random variables that we developed in the previous assignment to explore different strategies for playing the game of roulette.

#### Instructions

- Don't be constrained by the questions.
    If you want to ask something deeper, then go for it!
- Answer the following questions, and show all your R code.
- Upload your submission to Canvas in nicely formatted HTML generated from Rstudio.

Below are some functions and code you can use to complete the assignment.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
even = function(x)
{
    win = (x %% 2 == 0) & (x != 0)
    ifelse(win, 1, -1)
}


high = function(x)
{
    win = (18 < x) & (x != 0)
    ifelse(win, 1, -1)
}


column1 = function(x)
{
    ifelse(x %% 3 == 1, 2, -1)
}


straightup = function(x, d = 1)
{
    ifelse(x == d, 35, -1)
}


# Construct a simple betting strategy
simple_strategy = function(bet = even)
{
    function(x) cumsum(bet(x))
}


#' Simulate plays from a betting strategy
#'
#' @param strategy
#' @param nplayers number of players to use this strategy
#' @param ntimes number of times each player should play
play = function(strategy = simple_strategy()
    , nplayers = 100L
    , ntimes = 1000L
    , ballvalues = 0:36
){
    replicate(nplayers, strategy(sample(ballvalues, size = ntimes, replace = TRUE)))
}
```


# Questions

## 1 - Simple strategies

> Create at least one visualization for at least one of the betting strategies above.
> For example, we can simulate how much a single player wins at each time if she sits down and plays 20 games, always betting one unit of money on even, as follows.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())  # Feel free to set different themes

set.seed(893) # Starts the random number generator at a particular place, so the graph will look the same for everyone.
ntimes = 20
d = data.frame(time = seq(ntimes))
s = simple_strategy(even)
d$winnings = play(s, nplayers = 1, ntimes = ntimes)

g = ggplot() + labs(title = "Single game of roulette", caption = "Simulated winnings over time for a single roulette player betting one dollar on evens every time.")
g = g + geom_line(aes(time, winnings), data = d)
print(g)
```

> One fun visualization is to draw many partially overlapping opaque lines, with each line representing a sequence of winnings by a single player.
> You can also add:
> 
> - A line for the expected value of winnings at each point in time
> - A line for the actual simulated average won by each player at each point in time
> - Labeled vertical and horizontal lines representing typical player behavior, or casino betting limits.
> 
> Comment on your visualization(s).
> What does it show?
> What questions does it answer?

## 1 - Martingale strategy

> The simplest [martingale strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)) for betting on a game with nearly equal chances of win and loss is to start with the minimum bet, and then double your previous bet every time you lose.
> If you win, then you again start fresh by betting the minimum amount.
> It's possible to use this strategy in roulette, but what will happen?

```{r}
doublebet = function(x, initialbet = 1, strategy = even)
{
    winnings = rep(NA, length(x))
    betsize = initialbet
    current_winnings = 0
    for(i in seq_along(x)){
        if(strategy(x[i]) == 1){
            current_winnings = current_winnings + betsize
            betsize = initialbet
        } else {
            current_winnings = current_winnings - betsize
            betsize = 2 * betsize
        }
        winnings[i] = current_winnings
    }
    winnings
}
```

> `doublebet` implements the basic martingale doubling strategy (very inefficiently ðŸ˜¬, but that's fine for now).
> Describe in detail what this function does, and how you believe it works.
> What are the arguments?
> What kind of objects makes sense to pass in as arguments?

TODO: explain `doublebet`.


## 3 - Analyzing the martingale strategy

> We can simulate from the martingale strategy as follows.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ntimes = 30
m = data.frame(time = seq(ntimes))
m$winnings = play(doublebet, nplayers = 1, ntimes = ntimes)

g = ggplot() + labs(title = "The Martingale Strategy in Roulette", caption = "Simulated winnings over time for a single roulette player following the basic martingale betting strategy.")
g = g + geom_line(aes(time, winnings), data = m)
print(g)
```

> Simulate and investigate different scenarios to create at least one visualization of the martingale strategy.
> Comment on your visualization(s) and address the following.
>
> 1. Under what assumptions does the martingale strategy work in theory?
> 2. Could the martingale strategy work in practice, given table limits?
> 3. Is it good or bad for casinos if players use the martingale strategy?
>       Does it depend on whether the casino is large or small?

```{r}
# TODO create visualization(s)
```

TODO explain visualization(s)


## 4 - Advising a friend

> Suppose someone you care about is going to visit Las Vegas, and is enthusiastic about the martingale strategy, but they have no background in math and logic.
> Explain to this person, in simple terms, what the best strategy is for them to play roulette and why.
