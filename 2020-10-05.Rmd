- Compare and contrast special values `Inf`, `NaN`, `NA`, `NULL`
- Predict propagation of `NA` through vectorized operations
- Test for presence of special values

## Testing for special values




## Other special values



## Summary


Sometimes arithmetic doesn't work out.
If this happens, then we might get one of the numeric special values.

- `Inf` means infinity
- `NaN` means "Not a Number"

There are two other more general special values.

- `NA` represents missing values in a vector
- `NULL` is a placeholder for ambiguous objects
