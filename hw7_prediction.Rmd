#### Instructions

- Answer the following questions, and show all your R code.
- Upload your submission to Canvas in nicely formatted HTML generated from Rstudio.


## generating simulated data

Choose `n` between 30 and 200, and sample `n` values for `x` from a random uniform (0, 1) distribution.
Define `y` corresponding to `x` from the following quadratic function:

  7 y = 5*x^2 - 4*x - 10 + noise
   
$$
y = 5x^2 - 4x - 10 + \epsilon
$$

Here Îµ is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1.
Plot your data.

```{r}
set.seed(138)

# TODO
```

## linear model

Use `lm(y ~ x)` to fit a linear model to the data.
What mathematical function of `x` does the fitted model represent?


## quadratic model

Create a new linear model than includes a quadratic `x^2` term, for example, using `lm(y ~ x + I(x^2))`.
What mathematical function of `x` does the fitted model represent?


## comparing models

Plot lines for the linear and quadratic model together with the data points.
Which appears to do a better job fitting the data?
Explain.


## recursive partitioning

- Fit a recursive partitioning model to the data using `rpart`.
- Experiment with the parameters of the algorithm by passing different parameters to the algorithm, see `?rpart.control`.
- Which parameters appear to make the recursive partitioning model fit better or worse?
- Plot and compare two different models from `rpart` for this data set.


## test data performance

Simulate more values from the true model

$$
y = 5x^2 - 4x - 10 + \epsilon
$$

Compare the performance of three different models (linear, quadratic, and recursive partitioning) on this test set.
Which model does the best job minimizing the sum of squared error?
