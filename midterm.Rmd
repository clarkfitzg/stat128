#### Instructions

- Leave all the calls to `check()` where they are, and use these to verify that you got the right answer.
- Answer the following questions, and show all your R code.
- Upload your submission to Canvas in nicely formatted HTML generated from Rstudio.


## 1

(2 pts)

Use `seq` to create a vector `x` containing the sequence -2.0, -1.9, ..., 4.9, 5.0.

```{r}
# TODO
x = seq(from = -2, to = 5, by = 0.1)

check(x[1] == -2)
check(length(x) == 71)
```

## 2

(4 pts)

The function `dunif` in R evaluates the probability density function (PDF) for the uniform distribution on the interval from ‘min’ to ‘max’.

- Call `dunif` on `x` to create and plot three lines with different colors on the same graph.
- Add titles and axis labels as appropriate.

Your plot should include one line for the PDF of a Uniform(0, 1) distribution, one line for the PDF of a Uniform(-1, 2) distribution, and one line for the PDF of a Uniform(0.5, 2.5) distribution.
Hint: You can compute the PDF of a Uniform(a, b) distribution with `dunif(..., min = a, max = b)`.

```{r}
d = rbind(data.frame(x, y = dunif(x), dist = "Uniform(0, 1)")
          , data.frame(x, y = dunif(x, min = -1, max = 2))
          , data.frame(x, y = dunif(x, min = 0.5, max = 2.5))
)


```


## 3

(5 pts)

Define and implement a function `dunif2` that accepts the arguments `x`, `min`, `max`, and behaves exactly like `dunif`.
Don't do `dunif2 = dunif`, that's cheating :)
Don't worry about the `log` argument to `dunif`.

```{r}
dunif2 = function(x, min = 0, max = 1)
{
  height = 1 / (max - min)
  inside_interval = (min <= x) & (x <= max)
  ifelse(inside_interval, height, 0)
}

x3 = seq(from = -10, to = 10)
check(close_enough(
  dunif(x3), dunif2(x3)
))
check(close_enough(
  dunif(x3, min = -0.5, max = 2.5), 
  dunif2(x3, min = -0.5, max = 2.5)
))
```

## 4

(3 pts)

Define `mtcars2` by selecting the rows of `mtcars` that have `mpg` higher than the median value of `mpg`, and have `cyl` equal to 4.

```{r}
# TODO

check(nrow(mtcars2) == 11)
```


## 5

(2 pts)

In the following broken code, the goal was to produce a scatter plot of the `mtcars` data frame with `disp` on the x axis, and `mpg` on the y axis, and color determined by `gear`.
Fix the code so it makes the correct plot.

```{r}
#g = ggplot(data = mtcars)
#  geom_line(aes(x = disp, y = mpg), color = gear)
#
#print(g)
```

## 6

(4 pts)

Suppose you want to know the length of several objects in a list, so you write the following code:

```{r}
l = list(letters, LETTERS, 1:10, rnorm(5))

l_len = c(length(l[[1]]), length(l[[2]]), length(l[[3]]), length(l[[4]]))
```

What is wrong with the above approach to calculating the length of each element?

TODO: explain

Define `l_len2` by computing the lengths of all elements in `l` in an idiomatic way.

```{r}
# TODO

check(close_enough(l_len, l_len2))
```


## Auto Score

Your score below doesn't include parts of the assignment that aren't automatically graded, for example, plots, short answers, and data interpretation.

```{r echo=FALSE}
sprintf("Auto score:  %i / %i total points", .score$PASS, .score$PASS + .score$FAIL)
```
