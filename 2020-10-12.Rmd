## `source`

How to load a package:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Roulette

```{r}
ls() # list objects
```

123 GO - Where did the file below come from?
Local on my computer, or somewhere else?

```{r}
# Remote
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarkfitzg/stat128/master/roulette.R")

# Local file
source("~/projects/stat128/roulette.R")
```

Q: Does running code you find online seem dangerous?
Yes. You need to trust code before you use `source`.


## DRY

DRY: "Don't Repeat Yourself"


## Motivation


```{r}
set.seed(1380)

NTIMES = 10000L
NPLAYERS = 500L
d = play(simple_strategy(even), nplayers = NPLAYERS, ntimes = NTIMES)
```


```{r}
mean_theory = function(time){
    pwin = 18 / 37
    m1 = -1 * (1 - pwin) + 1 * pwin
    time * m1
}

sd_theory = function(time){
    pwin = 18 / 37
    mx2 = (-1)^2 * (1 - pwin) + 1^2 * pwin
    v1 = mx2 - mean_theory(1)^2
    v = time * v1
    sqrt(v)
}



#' Compute summary statistics for a particular time
#'
#' @param ds data frame containing columns: `winnings`, `time` where all times are the same
#' @return data frame containing 1 row with columns: `time`, `sample_mean`, `sample_sd`
summary_at_time = function(ds)
{
    time = ds$time[1]
    w = ds$winnings
    data.frame(time, sample_mean = mean(w), sample_sd = sd(w))
}

ds = split(d, d$time)
dq = lapply(ds, summary_at_time)
dtheory = do.call(rbind, dq)


dtheory$pop_mean = mean_theory(dtheory$time)
dtheory$pop_sd = sd_theory(dtheory$time)

dtheory$lower = with(dtheory, sample_mean - 2 * sample_sd)
dtheory$upper = with(dtheory, sample_mean + 2 * sample_sd)


NEXAMPLES = 30L
example_lines = d[d$player <= NEXAMPLES, ]

library(ggplot2)

sample_color = "red"
pop_color = "blue"
conf_line = 2

g = ggplot(data = dtheory) +
    geom_line(data = example_lines, mapping = aes(x = time, y = winnings, group = player), alpha = 0.1, size = 0.3) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = time, y = sample_mean), color = sample_color) + 
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = time, y = pop_mean), color = pop_color) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = time, y = lower), linetype = conf_line) + 
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = time, y = upper), linetype = conf_line)

print(g)
```

## Group Activity - Planning computations

We want to make the plot above, starting with a data frame like `d`.

Side note- there might be easier ways using builtin ggplot2 functions, and that's OK.
The point of this exercise is for you to be able to do any calculation to produce any kind of data you like.
If you can do this, then you can do anything :)

Questions (8 minutes)

1. What kind of object do we need to plot the lines for the mean +- 2*sd at each time point?

Data frame that with columns `mean`, `sd`, `time`

2. What steps do we need to take to produce such an object?

Create a function to calculate the mean winnings at every time point.

Hint: Be specific.
Think about a data frame that will work well with ggplot2


## Designing functions

Here are some general steps to follow when writing a function.
Order doesn't matter much, as long as you wait until the end to implement it.

1. Decompose large problems into smaller problems.
2. Decide what the inputs and outputs should be.
3. Create the function __signature__, the name of the function and all the inputs.
4. Have a test case ready, so you can check for correctness.
    TDD- Test driven development.
5. Implement the function.


1. Decompose large problems into smaller problems.

Big problem- compute summary statistics for all times.
Smaller problem- compute summary statistics for ONLY ONE time.

```{r}
dt1k = d[d$time == 1000, ]
```


2. Decide what the inputs and outputs should be.

input: dt data frame with only one distinct time value
output: data frame with one row containing columns mean, sd, and time

3. Create the function __signature__, the name of the function and all the inputs.

```{r}
#' Returns several summary statistics at a particular time
#'
#' @param dt data frame with only one distinct time value
#' @return output: data frame with one row containing columns mean, sd, and time
summary_at_time = function(dt)
{
}
```

4. Have a test case ready, so you can check for correctness.
    TDD- Test driven development.
    
```{r}
mean(dt1k$winnings)
sd(dt1k$winnings)

expected = data.frame(time = 1000, mean = -27.652, sd = 31.338)
```

5. Implement the function.

```{r}
#' Returns several summary statistics at a particular time
#'
#' @param dt data frame with only one distinct time value
#' @return output: data frame with one row containing columns mean, sd, and time
summary_at_time = function(dt)
{
    time = unique(dt$time)
    data.frame(time, mean = mean(dt$winnings), sd = sd(dt$winnings))
}
```


```{r}
summary_at_time(dt1k)
```

```{r}
summary_at_time2 = function(dt, col = "winnings")
{
    time = unique(dt$time)
    col_of_interest = dt[, col]
    data.frame(time, mean = mean(col_of_interest), sd = sd(col_of_interest))
}

summary_at_time2(dt1k)
```



```{r}
# Make sure it really only has 1 time in there!
summary_at_time3 = function(dt, col = "winnings")
{
    time = unique(dt$time)
    if(length(time) != 1L){
        stop("Require exactly 1 time value")
    }
    col_of_interest = dt[, col]
    data.frame(time, mean = mean(col_of_interest), sd = sd(col_of_interest))
}

summary_at_time3(dt1k)

bad_dt = dt1k
bad_dt$time[1] = 1001
summary_at_time3(bad_dt)
```



```{r}
covid = read.csv("~/data/COVID-19_Case_Surveillance_Public_Use_Data.csv")
```


```{r}
sexmfo = covid$sex %in% c("Female", "Male", "Other")
covid2 = covid[sexmfo, ]

covid2 = covid[covid$sex %in% c("Female", "Male", "Other"), ]

table(covid2$sex)

# with(covid[sexmfo, ],
#      interaction.plot(...)
# )
```
