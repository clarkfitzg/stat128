I appreciate the honest answers to the question "how are you?"

We've all lost something without face to face interactions.
Lots of isolation, depression.
[CARES office](https://www.csus.edu/student-affairs/crisis-assistance-resource-education-support/) has a backlog?
Do people know of other resources?

Take 1 minute
123 GO- share one thing that keeps you sane, or resource you've heard about.

Current pace and workload seems about right for the majority of students.
New programmers are working extra hard, because they're learning to program, and they're learning data analysis in R.
Learning to program is hard, but it gets easier.

Suggestions for students:

- When you're struggling with code that doesn't work or you don't understand, try writing out your thought process as a stream of consciousness.
    Writing helps you better understand what your thoughts and expectations are.
    It can be especially helpful to do this in Discord, because then others can comment and lead you in the right direction, or learn from your process.


Most of what we're doing in this class seems to be working, so we'll stick to it.

TODO this semester

- Keep examples in lecture notes self contained.
    For example, don't rely on local files.
- List of functions / summary / review
    Good idea, I'll start adding this to the course notes.
- Provide solutions for homework. 
    I like sharing the best of your solutions- is this helpful? 123 GO yes, no?
    I was thinking of commenting what stood out to me as I looked them over.
- More breakout rooms.
    I've been trying for at least weekly, maybe I'll shoot for biweekly.
- More specific examples.
    We can do this in office hours, particularly on Friday.

TODO next time

- Break homeworks in half?
    Do people want this? 123GO - yes - biweekly assignments, no, ambivalent
    Due Wednesday and Sunday
    Weekly wins :)
- HW assignments due Mon-Fri
