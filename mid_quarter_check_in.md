How are you?

We've all lost something without face to face interactions.

Lots of isolation, depression.
It's reflected in your work.


Current pace and workload seems about right for the majority of students.
Learning to program is hard!

Suggestions for students:

- When you're struggling with code that doesn't work or you don't understand, try writing out your thought process as a stream of consciousness.
    Writing helps you better understand what your thoughts and expectations are.
    It can be especially helpful to do this in Discord, because then others can comment and lead you in the right direction, or learn from your process.


TODO this semester

- Keep examples in lecture notes self contained.
    For example, don't rely on local files.
- List of functions / summary / review
    Good idea, I'll start adding this to the course notes.
- Provide solutions for homework.
    I like sharing the best of your solutions- is this helpful?
    I was thinking of commenting what stood out to me as I looked them over.
- More breakout rooms.
    I've been trying for at least weekly, maybe I'll shoot for biweekly.
- More specific examples.
    We can do this in office hours, particularly on Friday.

TODO next time

- Break homeworks in half?
    Do people want this?
- HW assignments due Mon-Fri
