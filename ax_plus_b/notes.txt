Notes from https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson4/

- use an *Output function in the ui to place reactive objects in your Shiny app,
- use a render* function in the server to tell Shiny how to build your objects,
- surround R expressions by curly braces, {}, in each render* function,
- save your render* expressions in the output list, with one entry for each reactive object in your app, and
- create reactivity by including an input value in a render* expression.
- If you follow these rules, Shiny will automatically make your objects reactive.
