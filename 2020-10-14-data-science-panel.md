## Initial Entry / Training

- What kind of entry level data science jobs should I be on the lookout for, if I only have a background in R, SQL, and markdown languages?
- What kind of training is usually required to become a data scientist and what kinds of fields can data scientists work in?
- What would you say are the most desirable attributes in order to be considered for a new hire/intern position? 
- What steps can/should a new college graduate take to try to give them an edge when searching for a job in data science?
- What, exactly, do you need to become a data scientist? Education? Experience? Familiarization with data? What can I do as a data scientist, and how would that benefit me?
- What are some recommendations for someone looking into delving into entry level data science jobs, but that's more on the economic side of things?
- Algorithm optimization plays a massive role in Computer Science when it comes to things like sorting, structuring, and searching big data. Would you say that as a data scientist the role is equally as important?  Is it something worth studying immensely, or is it something that is only  really required for certain data science fields.
- Where in America and Canada are you most likely to find a high concentration of data science jobs?
- What are some data science certifications available out there? Do you recommend getting certified for an entry job position?
- Many times, an applicant will have basic to little knowledge of any program languages (R, SQL, Java), but are willing to learn (or currently learning).  What are some qualifications for you to take interest in these applicants in order to get your attention, or even hire them? 
- What background knowledge is required to become a data scientist? Is it possible to get a job in data science with a statistics minor?


## Personal Career

- Did you always have an interest in a career in data science or did you come from a different background?  How were your experiences during your transition from your initial profession to your current job as a Data Scientist?
- What made you decide to become a Data Scientist? How was this field first introduced to you and what made you take an interest in it?
- What do you enjoy the most about the field of data science? What are the sort of skills(be it technical, foundational, personal) that are sought after in the hiring process of a data scientist position?
- What would you say surprised you the most about data science and the data science community when you first started with your career? What did you find that was either in your favor or a setback?


## General Career

- How can you transition your career from software engineering to data science? Are you better of to start out as a software engineer and move to data science or the other way around?
- Are you required to be knowledgeable of an industry before you can successfully analyze it with Data Science? Or is data just data and understanding where the data comes from doesn't make a difference in its analyzation?
- How related are the fields of data science and machine learning?  Do they overlap into each other or is one a subset of the other?
- How many data scientists are usually working on a team together? What different roles do they have and what are the purposes of each role? How do the goals of data scientists change when you are working for different companies? Can you be asked to skew data? 
- Is there a route into data science that allows us to continue to work in a given scientific discipline? That is, is there a way for student equality passionate in physics and computer science, for example, to stay active in both fields?
- What are the main differences between a data scientist ,data programmer, data engineer and data analyst?
