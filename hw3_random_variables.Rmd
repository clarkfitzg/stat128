#### Outcomes

- Implement mathematical expressions in user defined functions
- Write vectorized functions
- Translate word problems and game rules into mathematics and code


#### Background

In this assignment we'll practice writing random variables using the game of Roulette.
We'll use them in the next assignment to analyze and understand the game.

A European roulette wheel has numbers 1-36 in red and black, and number 0 in green for a house win.
The dealer spins the board, and the the ball lands randomly on one of these 37 numbers.
Here's a brief [video introducing the rules of roulette](https://youtu.be/6nKBlWaRI8w).

#### Instructions

- Answer the following questions, and show all your R code.
- Upload your submission to Canvas in nicely formatted HTML generated from Rstudio.

In the code that follows, think of `x` as a random variable uniformly distributed on the integers 0 through 36, representing the possible values for a game of roulette.
Here's one way to produce a vector containing a sample of size `n` from `x`.

```{r}
n = 100
roulette_values = 0:36
x = sample(roulette_values, size = n, replace = TRUE)
```

# Questions

## 1 - outside bet

(3 points)

The elements of our sample space are the roulette numbers: {0, 1, ..., 36}.
In statistics, a random variable is a function that maps an element of the sample space to a real number.
Let h(x) be a random variable representing the amount you win or lose for a bet on the high numbers defined as follows:

$$
h(x) = \begin{cases}
-1 &\mbox{if } x \leq 18 \\
1 & \mbox{if } 18 < x
\end{cases}
$$

Define a vectorized function `high` that accepts a sample vector `x` and implements `h(x)`.

```{r}
# TODO define high
```

Hint: Use `even(x)` below as a template.

```{r}
even = function(x)
{
    win = (x %% 2 == 0) & (x != 0)
    ifelse(win, 1, -1)
}
```


## 2

(3 points)

Define a vectorized function `low` that accepts a sample vector `x` and returns the amount you win or lose if you bet one unit money on the low numbers, from 1 to 18.
Hint: you lose if X = 0.

```{r}
# TODO define low
```


## 3 - straight up

(3 points)

Define a vectorized function `straightup` that accepts `x`, a sample vector, and `d`, a digit between  0 and 36, and returns the amount you win or lose in roulette if you bet one unit money on the single value `d`.

```{r}
# TODO define straightup
```


## 4 - something different

(7 points)

Pick another possible roulette bet that does not have a 1 to 1 payout, and implement an appropriately named vectorized function that accepts `x`, and returns the amount you win or lose in roulette if you bet one unit of money on the single value `d`.
Write it in mathematical notation below as f(x).

$$
f(x) = TODO
$$

```{r}
# TODO implement function
```


## 5

(4 points)

Calculate the expected value of your winnings after each play for each of the 4 betting strategies described above.
It should be negative, because the house always wins.
